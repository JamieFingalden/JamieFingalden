Jamie Fingalden
👋 Personal Introduction

Hi, I'm Jamie Fingalden, a passionate software technology student and junior full-stack developer.
I focus on backend development, big data, and AI, while also gaining solid frontend experience through real-world projects.

Currently, I’m pursuing a diploma in software engineering and working as a full-stack developer — with Vue on the frontend and Flask / Go (Gin) on the backend.

I enjoy solving problems with code, participating in school-industry collaborations, and constantly expanding my skill set.
My long-term goal is to grow into a global developer capable of building intelligent, scalable systems. 🌍💻
