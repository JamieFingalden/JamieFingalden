# Jamie Fingalden

## 👋 Personal Introduction

Hi, I'm **Jamie Fingalden**, a software engineering diploma student and junior full-stack developer.  
I focus on **backend development, big data, and AI**, while also gaining solid **frontend experience** through real-world projects.  

Currently, I’m pursuing a **software engineering diploma** and working as a **full-stack developer** — with **Vue** on the frontend and **Spring Boot / Flask / Go (Gin)** on the backend.  

I enjoy solving problems with code, participating in school-industry collaborations, and constantly expanding my skill set.  
💡 My long-term goal is to grow into a global developer capable of building **intelligent and scalable systems**. 🌍💻
